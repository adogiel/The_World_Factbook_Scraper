# The_World_Factbook_Scraper
The project was designed to conduct web scraping from the CIA World Factbook website, specifically targeting countries in Africa and Europe with Beautiful Soup, Scrapy and Selenium scrapers. The purpose was to extract relevant information, store it in a structured format, namely a CSV file, and compare the scrapers performance.
